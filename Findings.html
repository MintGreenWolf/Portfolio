A major theme of these interviews was uniqueness and ability to perform the job. In fact, when asked what makes a designer stand out, one respondent said: "Uniqueness, confidence, experience." Another respondent, said that: "work ethic" was important to show in a portfolio.

These were primarily UX designers (What I dream of being). I found that I didn't like the box by box style and wanted something else. I also realized that in the realm of web and UX design perhaps the biggest competitor is Wordpress and not anyother designer.

The test asked participants to click the user's bio. Users found this test to be quite easy as evidence by their responses. Most users described the test with comments like: "It said bio duh" etc. The heatmap, pictured left, shows a visual representation of passing clicks on the correct bio button. In fact, out of 16 responses, 18 clicks landed on the correct bio link.

These questions were important as they were some of the main points I gathered from my user interviews. Although the my answers were mostly positive (See photo of the wordcloud to the left),from these I found out that my contact information is hard to find as one user said: " wut? no. call me ;)"

            <p> The cognitive walkthrough allowed me to analyze tasks and to take notes on participant anctions and their reactions. This was important as I was able to tell live in person what was hard to navigate and find in my interface and what was easy. It was interesting that sometimes participants would ask if a particular action was right. The cognitive walkthroughs really cemented my need to have a clearly labeled contact email. It was also a challenge to find willing participants and to not want to help them when they got lost.

             <p> User Stories were important because they helped focus me onto tasks that would need to be completed by hiring managers. They allowed me to see things objectively. I formed these tasks from the various other research I had done. I knew what I wanted to accomplish.

             From my user research I found that most thought my portfolio was interesting and cute. Many liked that everything was simplistic and minimal. For instance, the animations were pleasing to users who participated in my user reasearch. Many users commented that this was aesthetically pleasing. However not all was right with the design. 
        </p> 
        <p style = "margin: 25px 25px 15px">
             The design presented many flaws that led to users not understanding where to click or how to navigate it. One user said that he wasn't sure where to click to find the contact information. Should a user click my bio, my resume or both for contact information? 
             Also the pages are sparse and I haven't had access to my desktop and this has prevented me from finding relevant references of past work I have done.

                 </h3>
         <p style = "margin: 25px; margin-top:25px;"> To increase my chances of landing a job I plan to use both the positive and negative comments and findings from my research to better my portfolio. 
            Users were clear that the contact was hard to find, the resume and the bio could be confusing and the text inside of the circular links should be on the outside of the circles. Besides these fixes, I will include a contact button, more examples of work, and to clean up the code. 
        </p>
             <p style = "margin: 25px 25px 15px">
            
        I would also like to  continue building the portfolio and making the site itself an example of my work. For example, I am currently working on getting my website to be even more responsive and to include more interesting javascript and user interactions.
        </p>
                 <p style = "margin: 25px 25px 15px">
                
                In the future I hope that my portfolio will be a onestop shop as a peice of design in itself. And, of course, to get a job with it.
